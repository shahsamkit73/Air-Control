# Air-Control

Contaminated outdoor air quality is ubiquitously found in larger cities and is owing to growing industrialization that pollutes the air people breathe with pollutants like industrial dust, smog and other hazardous particles from traffic. The solution from a user perspective, is to install an air purifier system at places where most of the air pollution is produced that cleans the air from perilous air waste equipped with air quality sensing mechanism and allergens control substance. In addition, data from the sensor is uploaded to cloud for the purpose to observe and purification is done once the air quality index exaggerates the threshold which results in lessens down the environmental pollution as well as respiratory system infection.
